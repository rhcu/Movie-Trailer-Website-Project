#Movie Trailer Website
Movie Trailer Website is a simple project, which represents a list of movies along with its respective box, poster and trailer. Data is served as a web page. 
#Installation
Install Python 2.7 on your computer, clone the repository and run the `entertainment_center.py` script from your IDLE. 
#Usage
To use the website you can just run the required script, which opens the web page in your browser and in order to watch trailers you need to click on the desired movie.
If you want to create your own website with your list of movies, change the `entertainment_center.py` replacing existing movies with your own by the pattern:
`your_movie = media.Movie("Title", "Description", "Poster Url", "Youtube Trailer Url"`
`movies = [your_movie]`
